					            LINPHONE ON IPHONE
					******************************************

Linphone for iPhone depends on liblinphone sdk. To build this sdk, you must install both xcode with iPhone OS SDK  and MacPorts (www.macports.org) with the following ports:
-nawk
-coreutils
-automake 
-autoconf
-libtool
-intltool
-wget
-pkgconfig
-cmake (for ZRTP support)
-yasm
-doxygen


gas-preprosessor.pl  (http://github.com/yuvi/gas-preprocessor/ ) to be copied into /opt/local/bin :
$ wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/yuvi/gas-preprocessor/master/gas-preprocessor.pl
$ sudo mv gas-preprocessor.pl /opt/local/bin/.

Link macport libtoolize to glibtoolize (sudo ln -s /opt/local/bin/glibtoolize /opt/local/bin/libtoolize)
Link host's strings to simulator SDK (ln -s  /usr/bin/strings /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/bin/strings)

***********************************************************************
*******GPL third parties versus non GPL third parties******************
***********************************************************************
This sdk can be generated in 2 flavors. Firt is with GPL third parties, it means liblinphone includes GPL third parties like FFMPEG or x264. 
If you choose this flavor, your final application must comply with GPL in any case. This is the default mode.

To generate the liblinphone multi arch sdk in GPL mode, once the above commands have been executed:
	cd submodules/build
	make all 

ALTERNATIVELY, you can force liblinphone to use only non GPL code except for liblinphone, mediastremer2, ortp, exosip, osip.
If you choose this flavor, your final application  is still subject to GPL except if you have an alternative license for liblinphone, mediastremer2, ortp, exosip, osip.

To generate the liblinphone multi arch sdkin non GPL mode, once the above commands have been executed:
	cd submodules/build
	make all enable_gpl_third_parties=no

******************************************
****Third party, subject to lincense*i****
******************************************
The liblinphone-sdk is compiled with third parties code that are subject to license, specially: AMR, SILK and  X264.
Linphone activates/de-activates these codecs thanks to the preprocessor macros HAVE_SILK, HAVE_AMR, HAVE_X264 positioned in xcode.
Before embeding these 3 codecs in the final application, make sure to have the right to do so.
******************************************


In case you upgrade your IOS SDK, you may force configure by using make targets <veryclean>

Libraries are available from liblinphone-sdk/
