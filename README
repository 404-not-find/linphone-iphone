					            LINPHONE ON IPHONE
					******************************************

Linphone for iPhone depends on liblinphone sdk. To build this sdk, you must install both xcode with iPhone OS SDK  and MacPorts (www.macports.org) with the following ports:
-nawk
-coreutils
-automake 
-autoconf
-libtool
-intltool
-wget
-pkgconfig
-cmake (for ZRTP support)
-yasm
-doxygen


gas-preprosessor.pl  (http://github.com/yuvi/gas-preprocessor/ ) to be copied into /opt/local/bin :
$ wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/yuvi/gas-preprocessor/master/gas-preprocessor.pl
$ sudo mv gas-preprocessor.pl /opt/local/bin/.

Link macport libtoolize to glibtoolize (sudo ln -s /opt/local/bin/glibtoolize /opt/local/bin/libtoolize)
Link host's strings to simulator SDK (ln -s  /usr/bin/strings /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/bin/strings)

You may update variable SDK_VERSION from file submodules/build/iphone-config.site according to your iPhone SDK version. Current is 4.0
  
To generate the liblinphone dual arch sdk, once the above commands have been executed:
	cd submodules/build
	make all 

In case you upgrade your IOS SDK, you may force configure by using make targets <clean> and <clean-makefile>

Libraries are available from liblinphone-sdk/

AMR plugin
liblinphone-sdk contains Linphone ARM plugin. As AMR may require to pay for patents, it is not enabled unless Linphone for iphone is compiled with gcc flag HAVE_AMR.

SILK plugin
liblinphone-sdk contains Linphone SILK plugin.
As Skype requires that you accept its license, the plugin is not compiled and enabled unless:
- you compile the SDK with enable_silk=yes flag (make);
- you compile the UI with HAVE_SILK preprocessor macro (xcode). 
- you compile add libmssilk.so to the list a library (xcode).

ZRTP
liblinphone-sdk depends on the GNU LIBZRTPCPP extension for ZRTP support.
As the license of this library is GPLv3+ it is not enabled unless the enable_zrtp=yes option is passed to the make command.
Note that activiting ZRTP makes the license of the whole application GPLv3+.
