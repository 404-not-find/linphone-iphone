					            LINPHONE ON IPHONE
					******************************************

Linphone for iPhone depends on liblinphone sdk. To build this sdk, you must install both xcode with iPhone OS SDK  and MacPorts (www.macports.org) with the following ports:
-automake 
-autoconf
-libtool
-intltool
-wget
-pkgconfig
-gas-preposessor.pl  (http://github.com/yuvi/gas-preprocessor/ )

Link macport libtoolize to glibtoolize (sudo ln -s /opt/local/bin/glibtoolize /opt/local/bin/libtoolize)

You may update variable SDK_VERSION from file submodules/build/iphone-config.site according to your iPhone SDK version. Current is 4.0
  
To generate the liblinphone dual arch sdk, once the above commands have been executed:
	cd submodules/build
	make all 

In case you upgrade your IOS SDK, you may force configure by using make targets <clean> and <clean-makefile>

Libraries are available from liblinphone-sdk/

AMR plugin
liblinphone-sdk contains Linphone ARM pluging. As AMR may require to pay for patents, it is not enabled unless Linphone for iphone is compiled with gcc flag HAVE_AMR.
