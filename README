					            LINPHONE ON IPHONE
					******************************************

Linphone for iPhone depends on liblinphone sdk. To build this sdk, you must install both xcode with iPhone OS SDK  and MacPorts (www.macports.org) with the following ports:
-automake 
-autoconf
-libtool
-intltool
-wget
-pkgconfig

Link macport libtoolize to glibtoolize (sudo ln -s /opt/local/bin/glibtoolize /opt/local/bin/libtoolize)

You may update variable SDK_VERSION from file submodules/build/iphone-config.site according to your iPhone SDK version. Current is 4.0
  
To generate the liblinphone dual arch sdk, once the above commands have been executed:
	cd submodules/build
	make -f  builder-iphone-simulator.mk  all &&  make -f  builder-iphone-os.mk  all &&make -f builder-iphone-os.mk delivery-sdk

Libraries are available from liblinphone-sdk/
